## 📌 Project Overview

**Archiver** is an AI-powered Movie Rating and Recommendation System designed to help users discover movies they'll love. Our platform predicts movie ratings, classifies movies as HIT or FLOP, and provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences.  

The system integrates multiple machine learning approaches including:

- **K-Means Clustering** for user grouping
- **Random Forest Regression** for rating prediction
- **Apriori Algorithm** for discovering co-watch patterns
- **Cosine Similarity** for item similarity

It features a user-friendly web interface and a fully functional API for rating predictions.
